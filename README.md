#  Face Recognition based Attendance System
done a project work on face detection by using mtcnn and recognising them by using facenet.
there are two parts of code in which one file contain a way to recognise the faces in the the photo contain only one face in its image and second part is to detect multiple faces in image.

# working

first i am using mtcnn for detecting faces in the image and detecting them and extracting from image and replacing the real image by extracted faces.
storing that faces matrix in list and storing there name also in the list for training purpose and after that using facenet model for training and prediction purpose
